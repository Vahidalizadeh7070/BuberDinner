# DDD-Clean-Code-Architecture
This is a sample for Domain-Driven design and Clean code architecture. We have used CQRS and MediatR to split our command and queries and use Mapster to map objects. 
Furthermore, the Repository pattern has been implemented to fetch or post information to the Persistance layer.
